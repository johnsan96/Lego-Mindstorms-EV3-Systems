In this workshop, we will construct a basic vehicle using the Lego Mindstorms EV3 system and then program it using Java.

The initial task for the vehicle will be autonomously navigating a marked course. Subsequently, the vehicle's capabilities will be progressively expanded to include convoy driving with multiple vehicles and obstacle avoidance.

Finally, the vehicle will be equipped to perform position determination using either odometry or a satellite system installed in the laboratory. Throughout the course, it will be enhanced with external sensors and an external control unit.
